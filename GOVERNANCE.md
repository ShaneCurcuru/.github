# Shane's Projects are BDFL or BDUC

Shane's projects start as BDFL but may move to **BDUC**: Benevolent Dictator _Until Community_.

Shane Curcuru is currently the _Benevolent Dictator_; however the goal for most of my repositories is to attract a self-governing open source community that can determine direction and build each project further than any one individual can.

Currently Shane determines project direction and standards, and makes final decisions on PRs.  Contributors with similar-enough goals who show a sustained interest and contributions may be invited as project maintainers.

Once I've found at least three other project maintainers for a project, we will decide on the project's governance model by consensus among all project maintainers.  Models could include an ASF-style Project Management Committee, something like [MVG: Minimum Viable Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG/), or whatever other decision-making guidelines the maintainer community chooses.  We will also decide on a suitable GitHub organization to move the repository to.

Invariants in project direction include: using permissive licenses for primary content; and planning to maintain the project (or mark it as a read-only archive) for the long term.
